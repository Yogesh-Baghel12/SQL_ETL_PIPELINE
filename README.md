1.Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2.Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

3.Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.


# ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project involves:

Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

# Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
## Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications

- **Data Sources:** Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope:** Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
